In the outskirts of galaxies live dense clusters of stars, known as "globular clusters" due to
their spheroidal appearance. These clusters feature tens of thousands
of stars packed into a distance similar to that between our sun and the
next nearest star to us. Globular clusters are extremely exotic environments compared
to our sun's local galactic neighborhood, and the precise nature of how they are formed
is still a mystery.

I'm a member of the [SAGES](http://sages.ucolick.org/) collaboration, led by
Professor Jean Brodie at UC Santa Cruz. Using cutting-edge observatories, we
study globular cluster systems of nearby galaxies. Because these clusters are so dense,
they are extremely bright, and so they can be easily observed with modern
telescopes far out in a galaxy's halo, when the galaxy's diffuse starlight is far too faint
to see.

The [SAGES](http://sages.ucolick.org/) collaboration is currently conducting the
[SLUGGS](http://sluggs.swin.edu.au/Start.html) Survey, a combination photometric and spectroscopic
survey of the globular cluster systems of 25 nearby galaxies. We use wide-field imaging from the
[Subaru](http://subarutelescope.org/) and [CFHT](http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/) observatories
to study the full extent of globular cluster systems around these galaxies, then use spectroscopy
from the [Keck](http://www.keckobservatory.org/) observatory for in-depth follow-up
of the brightest globular clusters seen in the imaging data. Combining these two powerful methods
enables us to understand how these globular cluster systems assembled around these galaxies,
giving us a powerful window into just how these exotic star clusters slot into
the puzzle of galaxy evolution.
