When very massive stars (greater than eight times the mass of our sun) end their lives,
they are thought to die in massive explosions known as supernovae. These stellar eruptions
are incredibly energetic and luminous events, outshining entire galaxies in some ways.
However, both theory and observation haven't firmly answered the question of whether
all massive stars die in such a way, or whether certain subsets of this mass range
could do something more exotic. Measuring the mass of stars that have already exploded
is quite difficult to do; essentially, we must get lucky and have already taken a picture of
the star before it died. As a result, there are only roughly 25 such mass measurements
that have been made in the entire supernova literature. 

For my undergraduate research, I used an alternative method
to make many more mass estimates. Rather than directly measuring the mass
of a star that is no longer there, we measure the age of the surrounding
stellar population, allowing us a very strong mass estimate of the star
before it died. We applied this technique to a great deal of Hubble Space
Telescope data taken of the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum galaxy,
both within the local galactic group. We were able to make 115 mass measurements
of supernova progenitors using this technique, increasing the number of mass measurements
in the literature by a factor of five and showing that at least some
fraction of the massive star population in fact doesn't die in a supernova explosion.
