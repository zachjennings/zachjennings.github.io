I've worked on a wide array of projects over my career in astronomy; here are some of those I've been
most involved in. Please click the links for a bit more info about what I've done!

###[Globular Clusters:](gcs.html)
Much of my graduate career has revolved around the study of extragalactic
globular cluster populations. These fascinating objects are extremely exotic
environments compared to the Sun's local neighborhood in our galaxy. The global
properties of these systems tell us a great deal about how a particular galaxy
has evolved over its lifetime to appear as it does today.


###[Bayesian Modelling of Globular Cluster Systems in Wide-Field Imaging:](gc_selection/)
My thesis work focuses on cataloging and characterizing the globular cluster populations of the 25 nearby galaxies
in the [SLUGGS Survey](http://sluggs.swin.edu.au/Start.html). I am developing a novel Bayesian method for
simultaneous modelling of both the globular clusters and nuisance contaminants in our photometric samples. 



###[Hubble Imaging of Globular Cluster Systems:](gc_hubble/)
One alternative to ground-based globular cluster imaging is to use the instruments aboard the Hubble Space Telescope.
While the time is much more difficult to attain and the field of view is much smaller,
the quality of Hubble imaging is unparalleled, allowing near-perfect discrimination between
bona fide globular clusters and contaminants.

###[Ultra Compact Dwarf Galaxies:](ucds/)
Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies are star clusters which are intermediate in size and mass between
globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. The processes which create globular clusters are totally
distinct from those that create dwarf galaxies, and which family ultra-compact dwarfs
fit is an unresolved question.

###[The Mass Function of Supernova Progenitor Stars:](sn_progenitors/)
Once upon a time in undergrad, I worked on a project to estimate the masses of supernova
progenitor stars thousands of years after they had exploded based on the properties of their
surrounding stellar populations. By applying this method
to the outstanding [Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury](http://www.astro.washington.edu/groups/phat/Home.html) dataset, we were able to increase
the number of supernova progenitor mass measurements in the literature by a factor of five.
