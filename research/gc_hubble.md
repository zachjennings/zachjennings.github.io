While ground-based imaging is powerful due to its wide field of view, it is limited in
a critical aspect. The earth's atmosphere inhibits us because it both blurs out sources
and reduces the amount of light reaching us on the ground. We see sources with with less detail
from the ground, and can't observe the faintest sources at all. 

One solution to both these issues is to launch a telescope into space, which is exactly what
has been done with the Hubble Space Telescope. Using Hubble, we can see globular clusters with enough
detail to distinguish them unambiguously from contaminants, a task which can only
be done in a probabilistic sense from the ground. Unfortunately, time on Hubble is very
competitive, and even the largest cameras on Hubble have a drastically reduced field
of view compared to what we see from the ground. One can compensate for the small field of
view by tiling many images of distant galaxies, but given how tough it is to get time on Hubble,
only a few such datasets exist.

I analyzed one such dataset in my first grad school paper. I examined a deep, six-pointing
mosaic of the nearby galaxy NGC 3115. I performed both standard photometry of sources in the
image as well as size measurements of resolved GC sources, requiring one to convolve
modelled light profiles with the intrinsic point spread function of the instrument for
several hundred sources.
